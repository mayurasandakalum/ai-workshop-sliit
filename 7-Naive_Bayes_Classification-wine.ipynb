    "# Naive Bayes Classification using Wine data (UCI ML Repo)\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Naive Bayes Classifier](http://dataaspirant.com/2017/02/06/naive-bayes-classifier-machine-learning/) technique is based on the so-called Bayesian theorem and is particularly suited when the dimensionality of the inputs is high. Despite its simplicity, Naive Bayes can often outperform more sophisticated classification methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bayes' Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is based on the famous [___Bayes theorem___](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem) named after Rev. Thomas Bayes. It works on conditional probability. [Conditional probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability) is the probability that something will happen, given that something else has already occurred. Using the conditional probability, we can calculate the probability of an event using its prior knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' theorem is stated mathematically as the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$${\\displaystyle P(A\\mid B)={\\frac {P(B\\mid A)\\,P(A)}{P(B)}},}$$\n",
    "where $A$ and $B$ are events and $P(B)\\neq{0}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(A\\mid B)$ is a [conditional probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability): the likelihood of event $A$ occurring given that $B$ is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(B\\mid A)$ is also a conditional probability: the likelihood of event $B$ occurring given that $A$ is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(A)$ and $P(B)$ are the probabilities of observing $A$ and $B$ independently of each other; this is known as the [marginal probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_probability).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's _Naive_ in Naive Bayes and why is it a super fast algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is called naive Bayes or idiot Bayes because the calculation of the probabilities for each hypothesis are simplified to make their calculation tractable. Rather than attempting to calculate the values of each attribute value, they are assumed to be conditionally independent given the target value.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very strong assumption that is most unlikely in real data, i.e. that the attributes do not interact. Nevertheless, the approach performs surprisingly well on data where this assumption does not hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training is fast because only the probability of each class and the probability of each class given different input values need to be calculated. **No coefficients need to be fitted by optimization procedures.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The class probabilities are simply the frequency of instances that belong to each class divided by the total number of instances. The conditional probabilities are the frequency of each attribute value for a given class value divided by the frequency of instances with that class value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data analyzed in this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will show how to use Python scikit-learn's Naive Bayes method to classify origin of wine based on physio-chemical analysis data. These data are the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis determined the quantities of 13 constituents found in each of the three types of wines.\n",
